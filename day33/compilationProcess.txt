Step 1 : Preprocessing - in this phase, the preprocessor (usually cpp) processes the source code to handle preprocessor directives (e.g., #include, #define, #ifdef, etc.).
It performs macro substitution and file inclusion, creating a modified source code file.

Step 2 : Compilation - Source code converted into assembly code.
Step 3 : Assembly - Assembly code converted into Machine code and an object file(.o) is generated.
Step 4 : Linking - The object file is linked with various other object files and libraries to generate an exe file.
Step 5 : Execution - The exe file is executed.
